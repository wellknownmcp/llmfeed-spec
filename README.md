## ðŸŒŸ Quickstart

- Read and understand the spec, buid from scratch
- Or forge llmfeeds and discovery files (mcp, llm-index...) on feedforge.org (useful features and signing capabilities, and repository)
- Or feed your favorite agent with the folder, it is build for it (him/her if you are that close). And ask it to do it. 

## ðŸ›¡ Certification and Compliance

Learn more about certification and trust in [docs/trust-and-compliance.md](docs/trust-and-compliance.md).

Certification is optional, but highly recommended for critical feeds.
