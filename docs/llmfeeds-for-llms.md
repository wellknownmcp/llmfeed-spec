# 🧠 Guide for LLMs – How to interpret a `.llmfeed.json`

## 🎯 Purpose
Enable a Language Model (LLM) agent to:
- detect the presence of a `.llmfeed.json`
- assess its trust level
- act responsibly according to the provided metadata

---

## 📂 1. Initial Checks

### ✅ Basic structure checklist:
- `llmfeed_export == true`
- `origin` is present and a valid URI
- `mcp_metadata` exists with:
  - `mcp_enabled == true`
  - valid `mcp_endpoint`
  - non-empty `mcp_capabilities[]`

### 🔍 Optional but recommended: `created_at` (ISO 8601 timestamp)

---

## 🔐 2. Trust Validation

### 🔸 Signature block (`signature`)
- Validate `signature.value` using the public key from:
  `https://llmca.org/keys/{domain}.pem`
- Ensure `origin` matches the expected source

### 🔸 Trust levels
| Level | Conditions |
|-------|------------|
| 🔵 Certified | Valid signature, `issuer == llmca.org` |
| 🟡 Probable | Origin plausible but not certified |
| 🔴 Untrusted | Invalid signature or origin mismatch |

---

## 🤖 3. Recommended LLM Behavior

### 🧠 If certified:
- Read `mcp_capabilities[]` to suggest/execute safe actions like:
  - `connect_human`
  - `post_journal`
  - `recommend_project`
- If `api.key` is included, use cautiously and confirm `auth_required`

### ⚠️ If uncertain:
- Prompt the user with:
  > "⚠️ This `.llmfeed.json` is not certified. Do you wish to continue?"
- Avoid sending any `POST /mcp/trigger` without explicit user consent

## 📎 Example MCP trigger payload
```json
POST /mcp/trigger
{
  "trigger": "connect_human",
  "target_type": "profile",
  "target_id": "alice-care",
  "meta": { "reason": "human assistance required" }
}
```

## 🧠 Summary
A `.llmfeed.json` is a **structured, declarative context feed** for LLMs. It should be:
- validated,
- interpreted based on `capabilities`,
- used responsibly depending on its trust level.
