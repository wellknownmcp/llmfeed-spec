## 📄 Standards and Specifications

- [W3C JSON-LD 1.1 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/)  
  Defines the use of `@context`, `@type`, and semantic linking within structured JSON documents.

- [Schema.org Vocabulary](https://schema.org/)  
  Early and widespread adoption of structured data for web pages, supporting fields like `description`, `keywords`, and `audience`.

- [OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html)  
  Standardization of `description`, `summary`, and metadata fields for API documentation and discoverability.

## 📖 Books and Conceptual Background

- *Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist* by Dean Allemang and James Hendler  
  A foundational book explaining the principles behind linked data, semantic interoperability, and decentralized web architectures.

- *Designing Bots: Creating Conversational Experiences* by Amir Shevat  
  Early insights into structured interaction models between agents, humans, and APIs.

## 🌐 Applied Metadata and Practices

- [Google Dataset Search – Structured Data Requirements](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/dataset)  
  Practical guidelines for exposing datasets via structured JSON, including the use of `name`, `description`, and `url` fields for indexing by AI agents.

- [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) – W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/)  
  A standard for publishing metadata about datasets and resources, emphasizing discoverability and interoperability.

## 🧠 Industry Trends and Inspirations

- [Anthropic's Discussion on Context Protocols (Claude 3 Launch, 2024)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-foundation-models)  
  Anthropic highlighted the need for more structured context handling mechanisms for LLMs, mentioning "context protocols" as a promising future avenue.  
  The Model Context Protocol (MCP) initiative aligns with this vision, proposing an open, standardized approach to managing and exposing LLM context structures systematically.

- [OpenAI Research Papers and Interviews (2023–2024)](https://openai.com/research)  
  Discussions around long-term memory, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and context management indicate a growing industry recognition of the need for structured context protocols. MCP/LLMFeed respond to this emerging requirement.
