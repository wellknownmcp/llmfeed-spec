# Note for GitHub Admins – LLM-Compatible Feed Export

## Purpose
To propose an optional `.llmfeed.json` file at the root of any public GitHub repository, allowing developers to expose a structured, signed, machine-readable representation of their codebase to LLM agents.

## Proposal
- Recognize `.llmfeed.json` as a repository-level metadata export.
- Optionally render a button in the GitHub UI: **“Feed this repo to your LLM”**.

## Motivation
- Enhances discoverability of trusted, agent-friendly repositories.
- Makes codebases more accessible to LLMs without unstructured scraping.
- Aligns with MCP / LLMFeed open standard ([https://wellknownmcp.org](https://wellknownmcp.org)).
